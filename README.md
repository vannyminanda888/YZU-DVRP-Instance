Our proposed DVRP instances were generated based on data collected from our **IoT sensors installed in 30 different rooms** at a medical center in Northern Taiwan. 
This data contains 30 distinct nodes, with the following information in each column:


Column 1: Node or customer ID

Column 2: Total demand (in grams)

Column 3: Node section

Column 4: Appearance time

Column 5: Service time (in seconds)


The total time or time budget is calculated based on the current schedule, which is defined as:
(8 hours Ã— 3600)/1000 --> converting the time into 1000 time units.
